abstract:  
Malware detection continues to be of importance due to the rising frequency of security breaches and malicious software attacks in the digital environment. Attacks by malware have a big effect on computer users, networks, companies, organisations, and governments. The rapid introduction of new threats and attacks makes it difficult for these systems to detect and stop them from infiltrating the network, despite the development of numerous intrusion detection systems intended to protect data and resources from attacks. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are one such attack that can seriously harm computer networks and businesses.The study has created an APT detection system to counter these attacks using a variety of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based classifiers, which are better able to extract data features from enormous amounts of complex data and comprehend patterns to detect anomalies and potential threats. On the NSL-KDD dataset, this study compares and evaluates their effectiveness. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were revealed to be the most successful models overall after being evaluated using several evaluation metrics.
